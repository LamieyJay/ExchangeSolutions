# ExchangeSolutions

In this project, we extract business insights about customer purchasing behaviors, primarily by location, into a dynamic dashboard. This dashboard provides a graphical presentation of:
1. the relationship between the number of items, number of orders, and the amount of money made per location.
2. the consumer distribution and how this relates to the sales made in each location.
3. the locations with the highest and lowest demand.
